                "Real-time language translation is essential in our globalized society. However, most existing solutions (Google Translate, DeepL) rely on **cloud-based APIs**. This presents two major problems:\n",
                "1.  **Privacy Risks**: User data (potentially sensitive financial, medical, or legal text) is sent to remote servers.\n",
                "2.  **Connectivity Dependence**: Translations fail without an active internet connection.\n",
                "\n",
                "### Real-World Relevance and Motivation\n",
                "This project aims to democratize access to **secure** translation. Journalists, medical professionals, and travelers often operate in low-connectivity areas or handle sensitive data where cloud uploads are unacceptable. A **client-side, offline-capable** AI translator solves this by running the model entirely on the user's device."
